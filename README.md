# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## 📖 Overview
This project implements six machine learning models to predict heart disease:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The dataset used is `heart.csv` (1025 samples, 14 features).

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing (train/test split, scaling)
2. Model training (six classifiers)
3. Evaluation (Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1, MCC)
4. Confusion matrices visualization
5. Saving models into `model/` folder
6. Streamlit app for interactive predictions
